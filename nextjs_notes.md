# What is NextJs

<u>NextJs is built on top of ReactJs</u> <br>
<i>While React is just a library for creating interactive UI, NextJs is a Framework that includes server-side logic</i>

- NextJs includes its own routing library, comes with a compiler and a NodeJs runtime ~ a program that can run JavaScript.

## There are two main ways to execute JavaScript

- Within a browser or
- Within a NodeJs runtime
